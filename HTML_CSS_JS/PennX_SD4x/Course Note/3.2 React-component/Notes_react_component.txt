Components define properties, event-based state variable, and callback functions.
render() is used to render its HTML.




React 4 important parts:
1. render
2. proterties (this.props) - set when component is initialized
    - should not be modified afterward
3. state(this.state) - change during rendering
    - this.state to define
    - this.useState to use
    - this.setState to modify
4. Lifecycle
    - state lifecycle: mounting (created), updating and unmounting (destoried)
    - mounting: constructor, componentWillMount, componentDidMount
    - updating: componentWillReceiveProps, shouldComponentUpdate, componentWillUpdate, componentDidUpdate
    - unmounting: componentWillUnMount
